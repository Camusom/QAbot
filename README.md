This project included the following:

* Created and configured a vector database to store document embeddings and develop a retriever to fetch relevant segments based on user queries.
* Set up a simple Gradio interface for user interaction and built a question-answering bot using LangChain.
* For the Large Language Model, I used mixtral 8x7b.
* For the embeddings, I used Watsonx embedding model.
* QA-bot can answer questions about uploaded PDF files. When the script is ran, the gradio website can be hosted on localhost or any other location.
